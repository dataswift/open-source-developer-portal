# Create a Sandbox account

In order to create a test application and use the Sandbox Console tool, you must create a Sandbox account, requiring only an email address and password. Remember the email and password for this account because you’ll need it to log into the Sandbox Console in the future. Once established Dwolla will associate a funding source and add $1000 to the account balance to accelerate the onboarding experience.
